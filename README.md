2. Brief Overview Page: Top MSAs by professional count and salary.

3. Detailed Page: Occupation-wise breakdown of 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile salaries.

4. Map Visualization: Geographic view of professional concentration across the U.S.

5. Multi-Year Toggle: Quickly switch between data for 2021 and 2022.
